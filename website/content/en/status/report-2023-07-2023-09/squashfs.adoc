This quarter we finished SquashFS driver work for kernel. We now can mount SquashFS archives on the 13.2 or greater FreeBSD release and perform all basic 
read-only filesystem operations.

Code work includes:

* Implementing vop_lookup() and vop_readdir() hooks for directory read support.
* Implementing vop_read() and vop_strategy() hooks for files read support.
* Implementing vop_readlink() hook for symlinks read support.

We also implemented extended attributes interface functions for SquashFS and all the work remaining for them is to implement their kernel interface hooks.

There were a lot of bug fixes as well, one major one was to find out why we can't list the first entry of the root directory, turns out SquashFS could have inode_number as zero 
which kernel for some reason skips while listing dirents.
For now, we fixed it by passing dummy inode_number to dirent instead of zero.

The code review is currently ongoing with my mentor mailto:chuck@FreeBSD.org[Chuck Tuffli].

I'm happy to say that SquashFS will find its place in upcoming FreeBSD releases.
